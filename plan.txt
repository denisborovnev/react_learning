app1

- app1 - initial
  problems:
    - render all items on new item adding (but ok if add new item as last one)
    - too slow typing in input for new item adding

- app1 - just add new todo to dom 
     now only new item is added to dom after pressing add button

- app1 - reconciliation: inline if vs if - else
	why commented variant render everything

- app1 - fix typing problem
   moved list to separate component that recieves items and make it pure (shallow comparision props)

- app1 - HoC sample
   reuse/simpler testing
